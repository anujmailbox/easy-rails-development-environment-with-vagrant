### Tuts+ Course: Easy Rails Development Environment with Vagrant

#### Instructor: Markus MÃ¼hlberger

When developing a Rails app, you will probably need one or more of these dependencies: a database server, a key-value store, a background
worker or a search engine. Installing and running these on your local machine, gets messy fast. Data from your app can also interfere with
other apps you are developing on the same system. With Vagrant you can isolate these dependencies in a virtual machine, start and stop them
at the same time and prevent yourself and others from having to setup everything again, when your system crashes, or you are on a new
computer. In this course, you will learn how to create a machine with Vagrant, configure it for Rails development and share it with others.
