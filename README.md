## Instructor: [Markus MÃ¼hlberger][instructor url]


When developing a Rails app, you will probably need one or more of these dependencies: a database server, a key-value store, a background worker or a search engine. Installing and running these on your local machine gets messy fast. Data from your app can also interfere with other apps you are developing on the same system. With Vagrant you can isolate these dependencies in a virtual machine, start and stop them at the same time. You can also prevent yourself and others from having to setup everything again when your system crashes or when you move to a new computer. In this course, you will learn how to create a machine with Vagrant, configure it for Rails development and share it with others.


## Source Files Description

This repository contains the Rails app we are going to use as an example application for this course. It uses PostgreSQL and Redis, as well as Sidekiq for background processing. Of course, there is also a `Vagrantfile` for which defines Vagrant box!
